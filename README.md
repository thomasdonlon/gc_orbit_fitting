# gc_orbit_fitting

Tom Donlon 2019

This repo requires galpy, astropy, newby_tools (https://github.com/MNewby/Newby-tools)
and uses python 3

This is designed to be a galactocentric orbit fitting algorithm that takes in data points for candidate stars
and fits a best likelihood orbit to them. This method is not yet currently described in any papers 
(but one will likely come out eventually). Different parts of the method are partially described in the 
appendix of Newby et al. 2013 and Willett et al. 2009. 

Currently under intense development and subject to plenty of debugging, reworking, and changes.
